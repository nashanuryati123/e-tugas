       <h3>
        Growing Up in Structured Silence
       </h3>
       <p>
        My family was structured and intact: two parents, three children. From the outside, everything looked normal. But inside the home, family dynamics were shaped by emotional restraint and a lack of open communication. I didn’t grow up talking about my feelings or my day-to-day life with my parents. I became used to only showing the end results achievements, finished products not the process or struggles behind them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Validation and praise were rare. As a result, I started looking outward for approval. I became overly reliant on external validation and developed a tendency to shut down emotionally in situations that felt risky or potentially painful. Over time, I learned to keep things to myself, especially anything that might reveal vulnerability.
       </p>
       <h3>
        Communication Patterns and Emotional Impact
       </h3>
       <p>
        Family dynamics, according to literature, involve the ongoing patterns of interaction, relationships, and emotional exchange within a family unit (Goldenberg &amp; Goldenberg, 2012). In my case, conversations were limited to logistics or outcomes. Emotional issues or conflicts were not openly discussed. While my parents didn’t engage in visible conflict, their avoidance of emotional expression taught me to hide my own struggles. I internalized the idea that problems should be solved quietly and independently.
       </p>
       <p>
        This approach aligns with a form of negative family dynamic not because of hostility or neglect, but because of a lack of emotional openness and validation (Olson &amp; Gorall, 2003). I often felt emotionally distant, even though we lived closely together.
       </p>
       <h3>
        Family Values and Observational Learning
       </h3>
       <p>
        Despite the emotional gaps, I absorbed several strong values from my parents mostly through their actions, not their words. My father was incredibly responsible and hardworking. He always tried to give us the best and supported our desires even if he never verbalized his encouragement. From him, I learned that to achieve something meaningful, I need to be disciplined, strive for excellence, and never give up easily.
       </p>
       <p>
        My mother, on the other hand, was very frugal and financially wise. She managed the household budget with great care, and from her, I learned the value of financial discipline. To this day, I think carefully before spending, and I’m able to delay gratification because of her modeling.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another value that stood out in our home was emotional control. My parents never fought in front of us. I learned that problems should be managed quietly, and that emotional stability even if it means concealing distress is a virtue. This shaped how I handle conflict: I tend to solve things independently, often without letting others know that something is wrong.
       </p>
       <p>
        This fits Bandura’s (1977) idea of social learning values are not only taught explicitly but also absorbed through observation. It also resonates with Grusec &amp; Goodnow’s (1994) emphasis on modeling and daily interactions as key in value transmission.
       </p>
       <h3>
        The Shift Toward Autonomy
       </h3>
       <p>
        As I entered adolescence and later university, I began to challenge these patterns. I wanted to be more emotionally open, but it was hard. I wasn’t used to expressing feelings or asking for help. The Self-Determination Theory (Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000) helped me understand why I struggled with autonomy and relatedness my need for emotional independence had never been nurtured.
       </p>
       <p>
        But I started to grow. I began experimenting with emotional expression, talking more honestly with peers and mentors, and learning to accept both praise and critique. I also began to set boundaries in relationships, which was new to me. Understanding that I was allowed to express needs and preferences became a big step toward self-growth.
       </p>
       <h3>
        Lessons Learned and Moving Forward
       </h3>
       <p>
        Today, I’m more aware of the early influences that shaped my emotional and social development. While I still carry some patterns of emotional restraint, I am now more intentional in building healthier communication habits. I try to express my thoughts clearly, offer validation to others, and allow myself to be seen even when it feels uncomfortable.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my future family, I want to retain the positive values I inherited discipline, responsibility, financial prudence but also foster emotional openness and validation. I want to create a home where communication is not only about results, but also about the process.
       </p>
       <h3>
        Conclusion
       </h3>
       <p>
        This reflection aligns with the course’s learning outcomes by showing how family dynamics and values affect emotional development, identity, and mental health. Through self-reflection, I have explored psychological theories, synthesized personal experiences with academic insights, and demonstrated a nuanced understanding of the impact of family structure and interaction patterns on adolescent development.
