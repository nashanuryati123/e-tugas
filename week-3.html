<h1>WEEK 3 : The significance of Identity Development</h1>

<h3>Early Interests and Identity Conflicts</h3>
<p>Since middle school, I have loved dancing. Dancing made me feel happy. But my mother saw it differently—she believed that dancing had no benefit or future. She urged me to stop and focus on something “serious.” At that time, I felt like I had no choice but to obey her. Yet the pressure didn’t stop there. When I entered high school, the restrictions became even stricter.</p>
<p>From a young age, I was also encouraged to become a doctor. My extended family glorified the profession, viewing it as noble, promising success, and, most importantly, as something that would make the family proud. Initially, I followed that path, thinking it was my destiny. But when I entered the social sciences stream instead of the science stream in high school, I had to bury the dream of becoming a doctor. For the first time, I felt lost. I didn’t know what to pursue next. My parents then suggested that I study psychology, since it also involved helping people just like doctors do—but in the area of mental health.</p>
<h3>Self-Exploration and Social Tension</h3>
<p>At first, I rejected the idea and wasn’t confident about entering the field. But slowly, I began to develop an interest in psychology. Still, my self-confidence was fragile. One day, my uncle mocked my choice: “Yeah right, no way you can get into psychology. You'll probably end up in some vague, useless arts major.” It felt like I was being belittled—as if I had no future. I felt angry and wanted to prove him wrong, but I was also deeply hurt. That night, I cried.</p>
<p>According to Erikson (1968), adolescence is a critical stage of identity vs. role confusion, where individuals begin questioning who they are, what they believe in, and who they want to become. I felt I was exactly in that phase—torn between what I wanted and what others expected of me.</p>
<p>Referring to James Marcia’s (1980) identity status theory, my experience closely aligns with foreclosure—I accepted values and choices imposed on me without exploration (becoming a doctor, studying psychology, choosing IPS). Eventually, I shifted into moratorium—a phase of exploration (psychology, dance), but without fully committing due to fear of making the wrong choice. This fear stemmed from how I was raised.</p>
<p>From a research perspective, studies such as Kroger &amp; Marcia (2011) emphasize that identity development is not a linear progression but a dynamic process shaped by internal exploration and external contexts. My experience closely aligns with these findings, as I moved through different identity statuses depending on life events, peer relationships, and familial expectations.</p>
<h3>Parenting Influence and the Fear of Making Decisions</h3>
<p>As the youngest child in a highly protective household, I grew up deeply dependent on external validation. Even now, I often feel afraid to make decisions on my own. I always feel the need to ask whether my choices are “right” or “allowed.” I realize this isn’t because I’m weak, but because I was never really given the space to make choices or taught that making mistakes is okay.</p>
<p>According to Self-Determination Theory (Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000), the basic psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness are essential for individual well-being. Without autonomy, it is difficult for someone to feel empowered.</p>
<p>This overprotective parenting also affected my social life. In high school, many peer groups avoided me, thinking I was “boring” because I wasn’t allowed to hang out after school, couldn’t attend events, and always went straight home. I only had one or two close friends, but even they had their own groups. This made me feel like I lived on the edge—not completely isolated, but never fully included either.</p>
<h3>Bullying, Trust Issues, and Exploring Relationships</h3>
<p>Moreover, I carried emotional wounds from the bullying I experienced in middle school—both verbal and physical. That trauma made me closed off, and I became highly selective in whom I trusted. Ironically, because my parents were so restrictive, I became too trusting when I was outside the home. I thought, “These people are so nice and friendly. They even invited me to places I’ve never been before.” So whenever I was alone and met new people, I was extremely friendly and open to befriending anyone. I would even go along with them if they invited me somewhere, thinking it was exciting and fun. But in truth, I didn’t yet understand emotional boundaries or what healthy relationships looked like.</p>
<p>My brother was the first person who helped me understand: not everyone is kind. Through him, I learned to see the world more cautiously without losing my empathy. That moment became a turning point in my identity journey. According to McAdams &amp; McLean (2013), narrative identity is built when individuals organize their life experiences into meaningful stories. My story is one of quiet resistance, a search for direction, and small acts of courage to remain myself despite the many attempts to steer me elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Self-Awareness and Becoming</h3>
<p>Today, I still dance, I study psychology, and I continue learning to make my own decisions. I still need validation, but I’m starting to take action even when I don’t feel fully secure. My identity isn’t “complete” because identity isn’t a final destination, but a lifelong process. What I now know for sure is: I have the right to live life on my own terms.</p>
<h3>Conclusion: What I’ve Learned and What I Hope</h3>
<p>From all these experiences, I’ve learned that identity cannot be forced. It may be shaped or influenced by others and limited by social expectations, but in the end, it must be discovered from within. Identity is not a title we inherit—it’s the voice we learn to hear in ourselves, even if it’s faint and contradicts the norms around us. I’ve also learned that past wounds aren’t only sources of pain, but can be a wellspring of strength and understanding.</p>
<p>This reflection also demonstrates my ability to independently explore scholarly perspectives and integrate them with real-life contexts, aligning with the PBL goals of critical inquiry and research-based learning.</p>
<p>Moving forward, I hope to become someone who’s braver in making decisions, more confident in trusting my intuition, and more accepting that not everything needs to be perfect at the start. What matters most is to keep growing with awareness, honesty, and wholeness.</p>
