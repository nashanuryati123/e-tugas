<h3>Assalamualaikum w.b.t</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Nasha Nuryati Qorifah, and I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Developmental Psychology at the International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM).</p>
<p>This portfolio was developed as part of my coursework for the subject PSYC 7711 – Family and Peers in Adolescent Development.</p>
<p>
               I have a strong interest in adolescent psychology, particularly in understanding risky behaviors, forensic cases involving youth, and the impact of family dynamics and peer pressure. These aspects are deeply interconnected and play a significant role in shaping adolescents’ developmental outcomes, especially for those facing adversity.

<p>This site is part of my personal and academic journey as a Master’s student in Developmental Psychology at IIUM. Over the course of 14 weeks, I’ve had the opportunity to explore various aspects of adolescent development including how family, peers, romantic relationships, and even media influence the way teenagers grow, behave, and connect with the world around them.</p>
<p>In this portfolio, I share reflections, observations, and insights gathered from both the course materials and my own interest in understanding adolescents, particularly those facing risky behaviors, emotional struggles, or complex social environments.</p>

<p>I’m especially drawn to topics related to forensic psychology, family dynamics, and peer pressure, and how these factors shape adolescent experiences in both challenging and transformative ways. I also include reflections from the perspective of Maqasid al-Shariah—a values-based framework that focuses on human well-being and protection across all stages of life.</p>
<p>This project isn’t just an academic assignment; it’s part of my bigger mission to grow as a future psychologist and, hopefully, to contribute something meaningful to society.</p>

        <h3 class="resume-title">Navigating Identity and Peer Pressure: A Literature Review on Adolescents from Divorce Families</h3>
        <div class="resume-item pb-0">
          <h5>📘 Introduction</h5>
          <p>Parental divorce is a growing social phenomenon across many countries, and its impact extends beyond the separating couple to significantly affect the emotional and developmental well-being of their children. Adolescents, in particular, are at a critical stage of identity formation and emotional regulation, making them more vulnerable to the disruptions caused by parental separation (Patusniari, 2023). Numerous studies have shown that adolescents from divorced families are at greater risk of experiencing psychological issues such as anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, and difficulties in forming and maintaining social relationships (Ramadhani & Krisnani, 2019).</p>
          <p>During adolescence, peer groups emerge as a primary source of social support and identity reinforcement. The desire to be accepted and avoid social rejection often drives adolescents to conform to group norms a phenomenon commonly referred to as peer pressure. For those from divorced families, the loss of emotional security and reduced parental presence may intensify their dependence on peers for affirmation and belonging. Adolescents often seek emotional support from their peer group to compensate for unmet emotional needs at home, making them more susceptible to the influence of their social environment (Fitriyani, 2018).</p>
          <p>Peer pressure may exert both positive and negative influences. While supportive peer relationships can foster resilience and adaptive coping mechanisms, negative peer influence increases the risk of adolescents engaging in problematic behaviors such as truancy, substance use, or juvenile delinquency (Rachman, 2022). In contexts where parental support is weakened, peer dynamics become especially influential in shaping adolescents’ behavior and decision-making processes (Afiyah, 2020).</p>
          <p>This literature review aims to synthesize contemporary research findings on how adolescents from divorced families experience and respond to peer pressure. Through integrative analysis, it seeks to identify common patterns of vulnerability, behavioral outcomes, and potential protective factors that may mitigate the compounded effects of parental divorce and peer influence.</p>
         
          <h5>🧠 Impact on Mental Health</h5>
          <p>Adolescents from divorced families face a range of psychological challenges that stem from the instability and emotional turmoil associated with parental separation. Several studies report that divorce often triggers symptoms of anxiety, depression, emotional withdrawal, and in some cases, suicidal ideation among adolescents (Haker, 2005; Ramadhani & Krisnani, 2019). The grieving process that accompanies divorce varies by individual, but the sense of loss, insecurity, and disruption of daily routines are commonly cited factors affecting emotional well-being.</p>
          <p>In many cases, adolescents internalize the conflict and blame themselves for the parental separation, particularly if they have witnessed arguments involving their name or care (Haker, 2005). This internalization can result in persistent feelings of guilt and low self-worth, which in turn contribute to emotional instability and social withdrawal. Moreover, adolescents who experience intense inter-parental conflict are more likely to develop aggressive or depressive tendencies than those from families with low-conflict divorces (Pálmarsdóttir, 2015).</p>
          <p>The emotional toll is often exacerbated by reduced parental involvement or inconsistent parenting following divorce. Adolescents may feel neglected or emotionally unsupported, especially in single-parent households where the caregiver also struggles with economic or emotional stress (Wolf, 2016). The disruption of daily routines, changes in residence or school, and the absence of one parent can deepen a teenager’s sense of disconnection.</p>
          <p>Despite these risks, several studies also highlight protective factors that can buffer adolescents from severe psychological effects. Consistent emotional support from the custodial parent, open communication, and access to mental health services such as school counselors or peer support groups are linked to better psychological outcomes (Zaman et al., 2021). Resilience tends to be stronger among adolescents who are encouraged to express their emotions and who receive stable guidance throughout the transition process.</p>
         
          <h5>🧍‍♀️ The Influence of Divorce on Adolescent Self-Identity Development</h5>
          <p>Adolescence is a critical developmental phase marked by the quest for identity, autonomy, and personal values. During this stage, adolescents strive to answer questions such as “Who am I?” and “Where do I belong?” However, for adolescents from divorced families, the identity formation process is often disrupted by emotional instability, inconsistent parenting, and the absence of a stable family structure (Wahyuningsih, 2020).</p>
          <p>Several studies suggest that the dissolution of parental roles can lead to confusion in understanding gender identity and social expectations. Adolescents who grow up without the consistent presence of either a mother or father figure may experience difficulty internalizing role models, which affects their perception of themselves and others (Andini, 2020). This disruption may hinder their ability to establish a coherent self-concept, especially in environments where communication within the family is minimal or conflictual.</p>
          <p>Moreover, parental separation may force adolescents to take on adult-like responsibilities prematurely, such as caring for younger siblings or managing emotional burdens that exceed their maturity level. This phenomenon, often referred to as “parentification,” can distort identity development by prioritizing responsibility over self-exploration (Patusniari, 2023). Adolescents who experience such role reversals often report internal conflict, self-doubt, and emotional fatigue.
The loss of a unified family identity can also lead to a sense of isolation and a weakened connection to cultural or familial values. Adolescents may struggle to identify with either parent fully, especially if loyalty conflicts arise due to negative parental narratives or prolonged custody battles (Suryani, 2022). These dynamics can foster identity diffusion, characterized by inconsistent beliefs, unstable goals, and difficulty maintaining interpersonal relationships.
Nonetheless, some adolescents demonstrate resilience by redefining their sense of self through positive role models outside the family, such as teachers, mentors, or community figures. Supportive environments that encourage open dialogue, emotional expression, and self-reflection can aid identity consolidation even in the aftermath of divorce.
</p>
          <h5>👥 Peer Pressure and Influence</h5>
          <p>Peer pressure plays a pivotal role in adolescent development, as social belonging and acceptance become central during this life stage. For adolescents from divorced families, the emotional vacuum created by disrupted family dynamics often amplifies the need for peer validation. As a result, these adolescents may become more vulnerable to conforming to peer group norms—sometimes at the expense of their personal values and safety (Fitriyani, 2018).</p>
          <p>In the absence of emotional support at home, peers often fill the role of confidants, role models, and emotional anchors. This dynamic can be constructive when peers promote healthy behaviors and positive coping, but it becomes problematic when peer groups engage in delinquent or high-risk activities. Research by Rachman (2022) shows that adolescents from broken homes are more likely to engage in behaviors such as truancy, smoking, substance use, and even petty crime when influenced by deviant peer groups.</p>
          <p>The tendency to seek a sense of belonging and avoid feelings of rejection or worthlessness drives many adolescents to submit to negative peer influence. Jumita (2023), in her case study, found that adolescents who experience peer pressure often feel afraid of being excluded if they do not follow the flow of friends, including in risky actions such as skipping school or free association. This reflects how peer groups can be both a social support system and a risk factor, depending on the context and values ​​they bring.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, adolescents from divorced households may idealize peer relationships due to perceived instability in adult authority figures. When trust in parents is diminished due to conflict or emotional absence, peers often become the primary source of guidance—even when they lack the maturity or moral grounding to offer sound advice (Afiyah, 2020). This dynamic puts adolescents at a higher risk of impulsive decisions and reduced critical thinking, especially when peer pressure conflicts with personal safety or academic goals.</p>
          <p>However, it is important to note that not all peer influence is negative. Supportive peer environments—such as school clubs, mentoring programs, or faith-based youth groups—can reinforce self-worth and provide a buffer against emotional distress. The presence of at least one stable friendship has been shown to reduce anxiety and improve decision-making in adolescents facing family disruption (Wolf, 2016).</p>
         
          <h5>🛡️ Protective Factors & Coping</h5>
        <p>Despite the psychological and social risks associated with parental divorce, numerous studies have emphasized the presence of protective factors that can buffer adolescents from its negative impact. Emotional support from at least one involved and nurturing parent remains one of the most significant predictors of resilience among adolescents (Wolf, 2016). The consistent presence of a caregiver who communicates openly, validates emotions, and maintains routines provides a sense of security during familial transitions.</p>
        <p>In addition to parental support, schools and community environments play a vital role in helping adolescents cope with the aftermath of divorce. Guidance counselors, peer support groups, and structured extracurricular activities offer adolescents constructive outlets for emotional expression and social connection. According to Zaman et al. (2021), interventions that promote emotional literacy, self-regulation, and peer empathy contribute positively to mental health outcomes in adolescents from divorced families.</p>
        <p>Some adolescents also exhibit strong internal coping mechanisms, such as self-reflection, goal-setting, and spirituality. Jumita (2023), in her case study, highlighted how adolescents who actively engaged in positive self-talk, prayer, or journaling were better able to regulate emotional responses and avoid maladaptive behaviors. These individuals often demonstrate a higher level of psychological maturity and self-awareness, despite their challenging family circumstances.
Moreover, the presence of supportive mentors or role models—such as teachers, coaches, or older siblings—can help guide adolescents in making positive choices. Adolescents who receive consistent feedback, encouragement, and opportunities to engage in purposeful activities are more likely to build a stable identity and avoid the need to seek validation from risky peer groups (Brown, 2022).
</p>
<p>While not all adolescents have equal access to protective factors, these studies highlight that intentional support structures—both internal and external—can significantly reduce the long-term risks associated with parental divorce. Early identification and intervention, especially in school settings, are essential in supporting adolescents during this vulnerable period.</p>
          <h5>✅ Conclusion</h5>
         <p>Adolescents from divorced families face complex and multifaceted challenges that span emotional, social, and developmental domains. Literature shows a consistent link between parental separation and increased vulnerability to mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem. These difficulties are often compounded by disruptions in identity formation and an increased susceptibility to peer pressure, especially when parental support is diminished.</p>
        <p>Peer relationships, while potentially supportive, can also serve as a conduit for negative behaviors when adolescents lack emotional stability and guidance at home. In contrast, protective factors such as consistent emotional support from caregivers, access to school-based interventions, and the presence of positive role models significantly mitigate these risks.</p>
        <p>Importantly, not all adolescents respond to divorce in the same way. Individual resilience, shaped by both internal coping strategies and external support systems, plays a key role in determining outcomes. Therefore, educators, parents, and mental health practitioners must work collaboratively to identify at-risk adolescents and provide them with structured support during this transitional period.</p>
        <p>Future research should continue exploring culturally sensitive coping models, gender-specific responses to divorce, and the long-term impact of peer dynamics on adolescents' developmental trajectories. A deeper understanding of these areas will enhance the effectiveness of interventions and promote more adaptive outcomes for adolescents navigating the consequences of parental separation.</p>
       
        <h5>Reflection</h5>
        <p>As a developmental psychology student, the process of writing this literature review has broadened my understanding of the complex experiences adolescents face within the context of divorced families. Issues such as peer pressure, identity confusion, and emotional vulnerability are, it turns out, closely intertwined and cannot be understood in isolation from the broader social ecosystem surrounding the adolescent.</p>
       <p>The literature I reviewed indicates that divorce doesn't automatically lead to negative outcomes. Instead, it becomes a risk factor when not balanced with sufficient emotional support and a stable environment. This reinforces the importance of a holistic developmental psychology approach—one that integrates an understanding of adolescent developmental stages, family dynamics, and the influence of peers.
This reflection has also raised my awareness of the critical role developmental psychologists play in designing culturally sensitive and contextual interventions, whether through school programs, parenting workshops, or community-based counseling. With this foundation, I feel better prepared to contribute to supporting adolescents who are striving to form their self-identity amidst family disruption.

          <h3 class="mb-4">Empowering Adolescents Against Risky Behaviors through Maqasid al-Shariah Framework</h3>
          <h5>🧠 Introduction / Background of the Issue</h5>
          <p>Adolescence is a vulnerable phase where individuals seek identity, belonging, and independence. Without strong moral foundations, family support, and spiritual guidance, many adolescents fall into risky behaviors due to peer pressure.</p>
          <p>Recent incidents in Indonesia further illustrate the urgency of this issue. In Indragiri Hulu, a primary school student tragically died due to prolonged bullying (MetroTV, 2024). Nationally, cases of bullying, both physical and online, have sharply increased in 2024 (Inilah.com, 2024). These experiences often go unreported and leave long-lasting psychological trauma.</p>
          <p>Even more concerning, in Singkawang (2025), a teenage girl gave birth in secrecy and abandoned her newborn in a public restroom (SuaraKalbar.co.id, 2025). The case reflects the critical absence of communication, value education, and safe support systems in the adolescent’s life.</p>
          <p>These real-life cases highlight how peer pressure, social stigma, and lack of emotional literacy contribute to behavior that endangers the adolescent’s safety, dignity, and future. From the lens of Maqasid al-Shariah, such situations clearly violate Hifz al-Nafs (protection of life), Hifz al-Aql (protection of intellect), Hifz al-Din (protection of faith), and Hifz al-Nasl (protection of lineage).</p>
          <h5>🎯 Objectives of the Project</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>•	Promote awareness among adolescents about the consequences of risky behaviors and peer influence.</li>
            <li>•	Strengthen spiritual and emotional resilience through value-based education.</li>
            <li>•	Develop preventive community-based support grounded in Islamic principles.</li>
            <li>•	Align all proposed actions with the objectives of Maqasid al-Shariah for holistic adolescent development.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>⚖️ Integration of Maqasid al-Shariah</h5>

                  <td>Hifz al-Din (Protection of Faith)</td>
                  <td>Builds inner discipline and self-worth through spiritual guidance and reflection.</td>

                </tr>

          <h5>🛠️ Proposed Plan: <em>S.A.F.E. Teens Initiative</em> (Self-Awareness and Faith Empowerment)</h5>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Peer Mentoring Circles:</strong> o	Youth-led safe spaces guided by trained mentors to discuss peer influence, decision-making, and identity.</li>
            <li><strong>Faith-Based Workshops:</strong>o	Interactive sessions on Islamic values, peer pressure resistance, and spiritual protection against risky behavior.</li>
            <li><strong>Media Campaign:</strong> o	Use of social media (TikTok, Instagram) to spread short, relatable messages promoting Maqasid-aligned values.</li>
            <li><strong>Family Engagement:</strong> o	Parental sessions (online/offline) to educate on communication, teen psychology, and early intervention signs.</li>
            <li><strong>Spiritual Reflection:</strong>o	Halaqah-style gatherings, journaling, or guided discussions to reconnect adolescents with their spiritual compass.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>📈 Expected Outcomes</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>•	Increased understanding of personal risk and resistance to peer pressure.</li>
            <li>•	Stronger internal values and spiritual literacy in decision-making.</li>
            <li>•	Improved parent–teen communication and trust.</li>
            <li>•	Reduced occurrence of harmful behaviors among youth.</li>
            <li>•	Establishment of school/community-based Maqasid-focused support systems.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>✅ Conclusion</h5>
          <p>The rise in adolescent behavioral crises across Indonesia underscores the need for a proactive, value-based intervention model. The proposed S.A.F.E. Teens Initiative offers a comprehensive framework grounded in Maqasid al-Shariah, not only to prevent harm but also to empower adolescents with purpose, protection, and guidance. By promoting Hifz al-Nafs, Hifz al-Aql, Hifz al-Din, and Hifz al-Nasl, this initiative seeks to protect the next generation — spiritually, emotionally, socially, and intellectually.</p>
